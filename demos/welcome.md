GA306 - Week 7

🐍 Write me a function 🐍

Using your own asset in Maya, write a function that selects and transforms objects
in your scene.

Any transformation is fine, including things like its name, color, etc.

If you do not have an asset you'd like to work on, create some basic shapes and
connect their rotation and translation attributes in a novel way.

The goal is to do a quick bit of programming to get you back into the right
head-space for class.

<!-- GA306 Week 5

Write a script that creates a sphere and a cube. Then connect the translation of the sphere to the rotation of the cube.

Save your script as rotate.py and send to instructor via slack.

Hint: Use the connectAttr() function described on p. 42 of your text. -->

<!-- GA306 Week 4

Write a program that uses a For Loop to print your name plus the following string: " awesome"

Your output should use **your name** but look like this:

j awesome
u awesome
s awesome
t awesome
i awesome
n awesome

Save your file as "awesome.py" and send to instructor via slack. -->

<!-- GA-306 Week 3
