Congratulations! You have made it to the last class!

Final Project submission guidelines:

Project Description: Write a brief description of your project and how it can be used and save it as 'readme.txt' or another format such as .md

Project Folder: Save all your files in a single directory and commit that directory to github.

Your submission should have everything a user would need to run your script.

Commit your project to github and send a link via slack to your final project folder. If you files are too large for github, upload them to Google drive and provide a link to the files in your README file and to instructor in slack.

You are dismissed once your project is turned in as instructed.

Be sure to take advantage of this time to finish any homework!!!
