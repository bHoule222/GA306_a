The goal of tutoring is to help you learn and master skills so you can then confidently apply them on your own. Tutoring is helpful for students at all levels. Our tutors are most often fellow students who have excelled in the subjects for which they tutor. You may find a tutor by visiting the Knowledge Hub on the 2nd floor.  You can also get tutoring information on our Facebook page (search for AiPD Tutoring). Email Bill Siebold at wsiebold@aii.edu.

ADA Statement
The Art Institute of Portland provides accommodations to qualified students with disabilities. The Office of Disability Services assists qualified students with disabilities in the process of acquiring reasonable and appropriate accommodations and in supporting equal access to services, programs and activities at The Art Institute of Portland.
Students who seek reasonable accommodations should notify The Office of Disability Support Services (1-888-855-0567 or theCenterDSS@edmc.edu) of their specific limitations and, if known, their specific requested accommodations. Students will be asked to supply official documentation by a licensed professional of the need for accommodation. Classroom accommodations are not retroactive, but are effective only upon the student sharing approved accommodations with the instructor. Therefore, students are encouraged to request accommodations as early as feasible with Student Affairs to allow for time to gather necessary documentation. If you have a concern or complaint in this regard, please contact Jonathan Scrimenti in Student Services Office on the 3rd Floor or call 503.382.4812. Complaints will be handled in accordance with the school’s Internal Grievance Procedure for Complaints of Discrimination and Harassment.
Evacuation Procedures
Please proceed to the nearest exit when the strobe lights flash. If you hear an audible alarm, follow the instructions.
Brewery Blocks: Evacuation location is around the corner on 10th between Everett and Davis; do not stand in front of the Armory or Deschutes Brewery

Park Blocks: The evacuation location is the large metal elephant located just west of the Culinary/Industrial Design buildings within the North Park Blocks between NW Park Ave. and NW 8th Ave.

Someone will come and inform you when it is safe to come back into the building.  **ALWAYS ASSUME ANY EVACUATION IS REAL**

Plagiarism
“Plagiarism, presenting the writings, images or paraphrased ideas of another as one’s own, is strictly prohibited at The Art Institute of Portland. Properly documented excerpts from others’ works, when they are limited to an appropriate amount of the total length of a student’s paper, are permissible when used to support a researched argument.”   

Attendance Policy for the Art Institute of Portland
Students who are absent from all scheduled classes over a 14-day period (2 weeks) are subject to automatic attendance suspension—from the Institute, not just from this course. This means the student is administratively withdrawn from all courses and cannot attend classes or continue in the current quarter unless he/she successfully appeals for reinstatement. Students who anticipate violating the attendance policy should contact their Academic Advisor or Academic Department Director immediately to discuss options such as withdrawing from the Institute or navigating the appeals process.

Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from courses
Schedule Adjustment period: The schedule adjustment period runs through the first week of the quarter (ending at 5 p.m. on Monday of Week 2). To add or drop a course, the student must complete a schedule adjustment form, available from the Registrar’s Office or in Academic Affairs. The signature of the student’s academic advisor is required to make any changes to the student’s schedule.

Withdrawal (W/WF):  The student who withdraws from a course or from the program during the first nine weeks of the quarter will be assigned a “W” code for each course. The “W” code is not used in computation of the student’s grade point average; however, “W” credits are counted toward total credits attempted. The student who withdraws from a course or from the program after the ninth week of the quarter will be assigned a “WF” code for each course. The “WF” code is the equivalent of a grade of “F” and is used in computing the student’s grade point average. Students wishing to completely withdraw from The Art Institute of Portland must file an official Status Change Form with the Registrar.

Absences Policy
Regular attendance is required for successful completion of this course. A student who misses the equivalent of three (3) classes will be withdrawn from the class. Exceptions for extenuating circumstances will be considered at the discretion of the instructor, who must notify the Associate Dean and Registrar’s Office of any such exceptions.

Grade Challenge Appeals
Students with academic grievances (faculty, plagiarism or other grading issues) have a right to be heard. The Art Institute of Portland abides by the following adjudication process to resolve student academic issues:

Grievance procedures regarding a grade should begin with the instructor. Students should discuss the grievance with the instructor. If the issue cannot be resolved, the Academic Department Director will mediate a grade review with both parties.

If the grievance still remains unresolved, students may petition in writing to have the grievance heard by the Academic Grievance Committee. Students wishing to file a grievance should appeal directly to the Dean of Academic Affairs in writing with accompanying documentation. Prior to filing a written petition to the Dean, the student must meet with his or her instructor and/or participate in mediation with the Academic Department Director. If the step is not completed, the Academic Grievance Committee will not review the student’s appeal. The Academic Grievance Committee will review student’s appeal upon receipt of the formal petition and documentation, the Dean of Academic Affairs will follow the process outlined below:
•	Forward appeal to the standing Academic Grievance Committee comprising of staff and faculty.
•	The Academic Grievance Committee is charged with examining the matter further and recommending a course of action to the Dean of Academic Affairs.
•	Student will receive written notification of the Dean’s decision.

A student is allowed one and only one petition per academic grievance.

If students feel that a concern or a complaint has not been adequately resolved using the procedure described above, students may direct complaints or concerns in writing to the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization, 775 Court Street, NE, Salem, OR 97301, or to the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, 8060 175th Ave. NE, Suite 100, Redmond, WA 98052-3981.

Grade Changes
All grade changes must be approved by the relevant Academic Department Director and the Dean of Academic Affairs, and must be submitted no later than the end of the second week of the following academic term.
